If you use exchange wallet or something, you can't receive your winning prize.

## How To Play?
You'll see a question about an event, news or whatever will happen in few days. 
All you need to do is answering the question. And send ETH to proper contract address. 
If you choose the right answer, you'll get your ETH back with prize ETH. If you choose wrong answer, you will loose your ETH.
